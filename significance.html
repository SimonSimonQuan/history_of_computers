<h1>Significance in Computer Science</h1>

<p>Ada Lovelace was best known for being the first computer programmer. She was also known for the Analytical Engine, a machine that would perform calcuations set before it. 
    Ada worked on this machine with another famous mathmatician, Charles Babbage, who was known as "The Father of the Computer".
    The Analytical Machine actually would have been the first computer if it had not been for the government stopping funding the project.

    The Analytical Engine was designed to be programmed with punched cards, an idea based on the Jacquard Loom, a weaving device incorporated in special looms to control individual warp yarns.
    In the 1840s, Ada described how the Analytical Engine could be programmed to calculate Bernoulli numbers, making her the first computer programmer in history and creating the first example of a software loop.
