    <h2>Significance in Computer Science</h2>
<p> Ada Lovelace was considered the first computer programmer. She has worked with Charles Babbage on the Analytical Engine. In fact, it would have been the first computer if it had not been for the government stopping funding the project.
The Analytical Engine was designed to be programmed with punched cards, an idea based on the Jacquard Loom a machine involved with creating fabrics with patterns.
In the 1840s, Ada described how the Analytical Engine could be programmed to calculate Bernoulli numbers(a sequence of rational numbers), making her the first computer programmer in history and creating the first example of a software loop.
